# smartcards
My notes and useful information about smartcards
## Example usage
- Protect private key
- Decrypt emails (OpenPGP)
- Use GIDS to log-in to Windows
- Pluggable authentication modules - use pam_p11 to authenticate using PKCS#11
- possible??? connect to eduroam using certificate on the smartcard
